Better if you are worried about large files and their effect on memory consumption. Default is `false`\n\n### Clearing the cache\n\n#### Clearing the whole cache\n\n```js\ncache.caches = {};\n```\n\n#### Clearing a specific\n\n```js\ndelete cache.caches['cache name yo'];\n```\n\n## LICENSE\n\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Fractal <contact@wearefractal.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

			| eLaborate is an online work environment in which scholars can upload scans, transcribe and annotate text, and publish the results as on online text edition which is freely available to all users. 
			| Access to the work environment is currently limited. In 2012 the tool was adapted for deployment at European CLARIN Centers starting with the Dutch centers. http://www.clarin.nl/
		p
			| eLaborate enables textual scholars to work on their edition on their own or in a group. Users only need to know how to use the internet. Project leaders can easily give reading and writing permission 
			| to members of their project team. They can select and add metadata fields and draw up a list of annotation categories they want to use. They can publish their edition online anytime they want. 
			| The edition will then become available online in a sober design which will be elaborated on step by step in the next few years.

				The work environment is developed by the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
				The new version was developed in the Alfalab project, making eLaborate4 the main tool available through the Textlab of [Alfalab](http://alfalab.ehumanities.nl).

		p
			:markdown
				Access to eLaborate is currently granted to scholars teaching a university course in text editing and to scholars planning an edition that is somehow related to the research programme of Huygens ING.
